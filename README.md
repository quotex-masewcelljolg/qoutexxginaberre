# Quotex OTC Signal: Trading Guide, Bonuses, and Troubleshooting

## What is Quotex OTC Signal?

Quotex OTC Signal is a trading bot that generates signals for
over-the-counter (OTC) assets. OTC assets are traded directly between
two parties, without the use of an exchange. This means that OTC assets
are not subject to the same regulations as exchange-traded assets, and
they can be more volatile.

Quotex OTC Signal is designed to help traders identify profitable
trading opportunities in OTC assets. The bot uses a variety of technical
indicators to analyze the market and generate signals. Traders can then
use these signals to make informed trading decisions.
